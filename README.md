# STC-QCB Advanced Computational Workshop 2024: Lattice Microbe Part

![STC-QCB Workshop 2024 Logo](images/logo.jpg)

Welcome to the repository for the STC-QCB Advanced Workshop 2024, focusing on the Lattice Microbe Part. This workshop is targeted to those who have been using computational tools for a while and want to increase their knowledge and skills. 

## About the Workshop

Diverse experimental data characterizing the cellular state and processes of the synthetic genetically minimal bacterial cell, JCVI-Syn3A, have been integrated into 4DWCM simulations of its time dependent cell states. Dynamics of the cell states and biomolecules are described at the composite particle level using Lattice Microbes,  at the coarse-grained atomistic level using Martini/GROMACS, and at the all atom level using NAMD2 and GROMACS. For each representation, visualization is performed using VMD.  The workshop will demonstrate how each computational method is performed on Syn3A and how information is passed between each program.

Hosted by [The Center Quantitative Cell Biology (QCB)](https://qcb.illinois.edu/), this workshop aims to provide participants with an in-depth understanding of the lattice microbe v2.4 for the whole cell modeling.

### Key Details
- **Date:** May 6, 2024 - May 10, 2024 
- **Location:** University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign
- **Format:** in person

## Sections on Lattice Microbe

The workshop will feature a series of lectures, hands-on sessions, and discussions led by renowned scientists in the field. Participants will have the opportunity to engage in interactive sessions that cover a range of topics, including:

- Whole Cell Modeling with CME-ODE on minimal cell
- Whole Cell Modeling with RDME-ODE on yeast
- DNA model for minimal cell

There are three different folders to include all the materials needed for each part.
