Welcome to the repository for the STC-QCB Advanced Workshop 2024, focusing on Lattice Microbes. This workshop is targeted to those who have been using computational tools for a while and want to increase their knowledge and skills. 

## About the Workshop

Diverse experimental data characterizing the cellular state and processes of the synthetic genetically minimal bacterial cell, JCVI-Syn3A, have been integrated into 4DWCM simulations of its time dependent cell states. Dynamics of the cell states and biomolecules are described at the composite particle level using Lattice Microbes,  at the coarse-grained atomistic level using Martini/GROMACS, and at the all atom level using NAMD2 and GROMACS. For each representation, visualization is performed using VMD.  The workshop will demonstrate how each computational method is performed on Syn3A and how information is passed between each program.

Hosted by [The Center Quantitative Cell Biology (QCB)](https://qcb.illinois.edu/), this workshop aims to provide participants with an in-depth understanding of the Lattice Microbes v2.4 for whole-cell modeling.
